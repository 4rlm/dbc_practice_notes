# Week 2 - Review and Reflect

1. Briefly describe your understanding of what the browser does, including definitions of the following:
* `client`: The `client` is the actual user-end, like a computer or mobile device typically through the browser.
* `server`: The `server` is where the files are being hosted or at least routed through.
* `render`: `client` makes a request to the `server` which sends the requested data, which is then `rendered` (or made usable/visable) to the `client`.

2. What is HTML? In your answer, include definitions of the following:
* `tag`: `tag`s have `<` or `>`, such as a `<p>`, `<div>`, `<html>`
* `element`: Like a package of contents, such as `<li class="active"><a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a></li>`.  In `css` and `javascript` we could target these elements for styling or actions, like an `event-listener`.
* `node`: Everything in the `html` document is a `node`, such as the document node, attribute nodes, element nodes, text nodes.  They are like distinct objects of the Document Object Model, which we can access to manipulate.
* `attribute`: Info inside the `tag`s, which provides additional info, like `class`, `id`, `lang`, `type`.
* `block element`: Default nature is to take up the entire row of the document, unless contained or manipulated by other block elements, like a container and/or via css.  Ex. `<div>`
* `inline element`: Default nature is to only take up the portion of space that the content actually consumes, so it is possible to add several inline elements side by side on the same row.  Ex. `<img>`, `<button>`.

3. Very briefly, explain the purpose of the following elements:
* `head`:  Like an intro to the document, but not usually seen by the human eye.  Includes info for the browsers to know how to treat the page, such as the title of the page and language.
* `body`: This is the part that is rendered for the human eye to see.
* `p`: For sentences or paragraphs.
* `form`: For housing/creating a form.
* `div`: For containing certain items, for example if you wanted to have a few paragraphs side by side in self contained boxes.
* `span`: Serving like an envelope typically around some text, like inside a `<p>` tag, which can be referenced for special manipulation.
* `select`: Used for a drop-down list.  Options are inside and can be chosen.
* `h2`: Like shouting.  It's for a headline.  Largest is h1, through h6.
* `ol`: Ordered list.
* `ul`: Unordered list.
* `table`: Like a spreadsheet.  Inside the table are table rows (tr) and table data (td); among others.
* `tr`: Table row = horizontal.
* `td`: Table data = vertical.
